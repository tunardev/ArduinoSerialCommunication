# Arduino Serial Communication Example

This is a simple example of serial communication between Arduino and C#. The Arduino sends a string to the C# program and the C# program sends a string to the Arduino.

## Arduino

It is a simple program that sends a string to the serial port every second and reads a string from the serial port. The Arduino code is written in C++.

## How to use
